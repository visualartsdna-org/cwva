White areas can be preserved in this way before the painting is started. Unlike white preserved with masking fluid, the area can never be painted over. Washes of underlying color can be preserved in this way too.

<tr><td>voc:watercolorTechnique</td><td>voc:inkWash</td><td>voc:washedInkwithGouacheMask</td><td>washed ink with gouache mask</td><td>For this technique, thick white gouache is painted on to preserve any areas of white paper. The gouache is allowed to thoroughly dry before being completely covered with pigment ink. When the ink is dry the surface is washed back with a water spray and bristle brush, dissolving the gouache and revealing the white paper underneath.</td></tr>
<tr><td>voc:watercolorTechnique</td><td>voc:liftingPaint</td><td>voc:paperBlotting</td><td>paper blotting</td><td>Crumpled paper towel will lift pigment from a wet was in a soft, predictable way. Keep rotating and re crumpling the paper so you dont get a repeating pattern in the blot marks. This is a good watercolor technique for lifting clouds out of a wet sky.

Removing colour from an area of wet paint, or re-wetting an area of dried paint and removing colour; a painting technique in it's own right, not just a correction method; the basis of subtractive painting.Lifting creates soft edges and can diffuse or modify colours, reducing their intensity and leaving only the undertones. Strategic or detailed lifts can be done using a slightly damp paintbrush to wick up the colour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>voc:watercolorTechnique</td><td>voc:removingPaint</td><td>voc:sandingDryPaper</td><td>sanding dry paper</td><td>Unusual textures can be made by lightly sanding the surface of a very dry painting with fine sandpaper. The surface takes on a slightly weathered appearance. The sanded area can be adjusted by the application of further washes.</td></tr>

<tr><td>voc:watercolorTechnique</td><td>voc:watercolorTechnique</td><td>voc:gessoUnderpainting</td><td>gesso underpainting?</td><td>With this watercolor technique, rough gesso brushstrokes add interest to the predictable texture of watercolor paper. Watercolor gesso or absorbent ground works best. The important thing to remember is to allow the gesso to dry thoroughly before painting on it. Watercolor, particularly sedimentary colors will settle into the fine crevasses in the gesso brush strokes making an interesting texture. </td></tr>

<tr><td>voc:watercolorTechnique</td><td>voc:watercolorTechnique</td><td>voc:indenting</td><td>indenting</td><td>Scoring the paper (using a stylus or the end of a paintbrush) directly after an application of fresh paint; the scored marks are recessed into the paper so pigments will naturally settle in the lines, showing off the scored details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>voc:watercolorTechnique</td><td>voc:watercolorTechnique</td><td>voc:loosePaintingStyle</td><td>loose painting style</td><td>The loose painting style is characterized by a quick and impressionistic approach to painting. Many watercolor artists love to work in this style because of it’s spontaneous and lively appearance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>voc:watercolorTechnique</td><td>voc:watercolorTechnique</td><td>voc:lostAndFoundEdges</td><td>lost and found edges</td><td>When the tonal value of the edge of a foreground object begins to matches the tonal value of it’s background the edges of the object start to become indiscernible against the background. This creates the appearance the optical illusion of a disappearing edge but the brain still interprets the edge as being present. This is often used to create a deliberate effect, used to create and suggest movement. A found edge is the reversal of this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>voc:watercolorTechnique</td><td>voc:watercolorTechnique</td><td>voc:opaqueGouacheContrast</td><td>opaque gouache contrast</td><td>The contrast between transparent watercolor and flat, opaque gouache can add interest and vibrancy to a painting. Be sure to keep distinct areas of watercolor and gouache or the opaque/transparent contrast will be lost. See the article on Gouache for more information.</td></tr>

This causes the paint to spread out (Bloom) and often leaves a cauliflower shaped pattern when dry. This is often considered to be undesirable but can also be done intentionally to create a textural effect.</td></tr>

Colors that absorb into the paper before the water has had a chance to evaporate; they’re difficult to lift and will leave a stain on the paper.  Not an indicator of paint quality as some pigments are inherently staining, and some are non-staining.</td></tr>

Stretching is not necessary if you're using synthetic papers (which are not prone to warping) or if you're using a watercolor block as long as the painting is left on the block to dry.</td></tr>
