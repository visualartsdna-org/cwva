<h3>AI Interpretation</h3>

To use, select the type of interpretation in the dropdown box and hit the "Ask" button.
A prompt about the current work is then submitted to the AI service and the AI interpretation results are displayed.
<br/>
<br/>
With each "Ask," an encoded image file or a URI for the image is included, and a prompt template, similar to the following, is filled in and sent to the AI service:
<br/>
<pre><code>
"Write a $m.kind 
of the $m.media 
with label '$m.label', 
on $m.hasPaperWeight pound 
$m.hasPaperFinish paper 
with height=$m.height inches, width=$m.width inches 
and description '$m.description'"
</code></pre>
<br/>

Where, $m.kind can be any one of the following:
Criticism, Evaluation, Assessment, Influences, Gallery Description and Technical Assessment.
<br/>
While $m.label, $m.description, etc., are taken from the data shown on the About (previous) page for the work.
<br/>
<br/>
An example of an AI prompt,
<pre><code>
"Write a Criticism
of the Watercolor 
with label 'Rhino Study', 
on 120 pound 
cold press paper 
with height=12 inches, width=9 inches 
and description 'A white rhino visits a watering hole.'"
</code></pre>
<br/>
<br/>
Google gemini is currently the only destination for the "Ask" AI prompt.
<br/>
<br/>
The web protocol for the google gemini API is:<br/>
https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-x.x-flash:generateContent,
<br>
currently using the gemini-2.5-flash AI model.
<br/>
<br/>
Given the gemini protocol is in a "beta" stage of development there may be some hiccups along the way.
<br/>
Also, this site uses the free tier of the service, issues due to exceeding token limits may occur depending on traffic.
